Introduction

IN this Flood & Disaster dataset, 5130 rows and 18 columns of data were analyzed for insight into the leading and major causes of Floods, and the resulting damage to Human lives and properties. I cleaned the data, did exploratory data analyses to answer questions such as: what is the total death count? What is the total population of persons displaced? Which disaster caused the most deaths and displacement? The varying effect of this disaster on the countries?

I  evaluated and visualised the data using  Tableau to find insight, which can help government, emergency agencies, and other concerned bodies on actions to take to mitigate the effects of floods and prevent them.

Problem Statement

A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that is usually dry. The impact of floods on the environment and our ecosystem can not be trivialised. This makes the issue of flooding a national and international concern. The following questions were provided with answers to:

What is the total death?

What is the total population of persons displaced?

Which disaster caused the most death and displacement?

The varying effect of this disaster on the countries?

The correlation of  Severity with the damage?

 

DATASET OVERVIEW

The Dataset contains 5130 ows and 18 columns, detailing:

ID	GlideNumber	Country	OtherCountry	long	lat	Area	Began	Ended	Validation	Dead	Displaced	MainCause	Severity
In order to provide clean, error-free, and presentable analysis/visualisation, I cleaned the Dataset using MYSQL, and created a visualisation with Tableau.
